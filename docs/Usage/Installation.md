# Installation                                     
 
 EWC is developed as an open-sourcen GitHub repository. To download the code, you can either install Git and clone the repository using the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/dyalog/ewc.git
```

 Alternatively, you can just download a [zip file](https://github.com/dyalog/ewc/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) containing all the code.

## Verify Installation

The simplest way to verify installation is to run the demo application:

```
]link.create # /path/to/ewc
demo.Run 'Desktop'
```

This will pop up a form with a Dyalog logo and a dropdown on the right which allows
you to select a variety of simple test applications that have been used to test
EWC during development.

Note that, if you use `]link.import` instead of `]link.create`, or you do not have
.NET and a File System Watcher available, you will also need to set the variable
`EWC.FOLDER` to point to the location of the EWC repository. For example:

```
EWC.FOLDER‚Üê'/tmp/ewc'
```

## The Demo Application

The [demo application](Demo.md) provides several examples that illustrate the use of
EWC. It supports Desktop, Browser and Multi modes - and will run in the mode that you
select using the right argument.

For each example in the drop-down menu, you will find the corresponding source code
in a function called `demo.DemoXXX`, where `XXX` is the name selected in the drop-down.

## Building your Own Application

After linking ewc, you can create a form as follows:

```
EWC.Init 'Desktop'
'F1' eWC 'Form' 'Hello World' (10 10) (400 600)
```

This should create an HTMLRenderer window with the caption "Hello World". For more
information on getting started, see [initialisation](Initialisation.md).

## EWC Development

If you are developing EWC, or you are working with EWC developers and need to
quickly pick up changes to the JavaScript client, it may be a good idea to clone
the client code separately. In order for EWC to automatically find this code,
it must be located in a folder called ewc-client, in the same folder as EWC itself.

You can achieve this using:

```
git clone https://github.com/dyalog/ewc-client.git
```
