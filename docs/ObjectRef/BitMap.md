# BitMap

The EWC implementation of [`⎕WC` class BitMap](https://help.dyalog.com/19.0/index.htm#GUI/Objects/BitMap.htm) has some degree of support for:

| Properties|  |  |  |
|--|--|--|--|
 |  [File](https://help.dyalog.com/19.0/index.htm#GUI/Properties/File.htm)  |  [Size](https://help.dyalog.com/19.0/index.htm#GUI/Properties/Size.htm)  |                                                                          |                                                                         |

## Known Limitations

The `File` property must refer to a file which resides in one of the folders
defined in the EWC.RESOURCES array. See [Images](../Usage/Configuration.md)
for more information.
