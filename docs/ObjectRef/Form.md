# Form

The EWC implementation of Form has some degree of support for:

| Properties|  |  |  |
|--|--|--|--|
 |  BCol     |  Flex     |  Size     |       |
 |  Caption  |  Picture  |  Styles   |       |
 |  Coord    |  Posn     |  Visible  |       |


| Events|  |  |  |
|--|--|--|--|
 |  Configure  |  MouseDown  |  MouseUp  |            |

Known limitations of the Form implementation:

Coord defaults to Pixel, Size to 400 600 and Posn to 100 100
