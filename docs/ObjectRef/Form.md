# Form

The EWC implementation of Form has some degree of support for:

 |   BCol     |   Flex     |  *Size     |        |
 |   Caption  |   Picture  |   Styles   |        |
 |   Coord    |  *Posn     |   Visible  |        |

* indicates that the property can change after it has been set.

Supported events:

 |  Configure  |  MouseDown  |  MouseUp  |            |

Known limitations of the Form implementation:

Coord defaults to Pixel, Size to 400 600 and Posn to 100 100
