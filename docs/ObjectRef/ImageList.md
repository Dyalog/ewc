# ImageList

The EWC implementation of [`⎕WC` class ImageList](https://help.dyalog.com/19.0/index.htm#GUI/Objects/ImageList.htm) has some degree of support for:

| Properties|  |  |  |
|--|--|--|--|
 |  [Files](https://help.dyalog.com/19.0/index.htm#GUI/Properties/Files.htm)  |  [ImageCount](https://help.dyalog.com/19.0/index.htm#GUI/Properties/ImageCount.htm)  |  [Masked](https://help.dyalog.com/19.0/index.htm#GUI/Properties/Masked.htm)  |  [Size](https://help.dyalog.com/19.0/index.htm#GUI/Properties/Size.htm) |

NB: Links above are to the complete `⎕WC` documentation

## Known Limitations

In EWC, ImageLists are defined using the `Files` property must refer to files which reside in one of the folders
defined in the EWC.RESOURCES array. See [Images](../Discussion/Images.md)
for more information.
