# ListView

The EWC implementation of ListView has some degree of support for:

 |   BCol       |   ImageIndex    |   ReportInfo  |   Visible |
 |   Border     |   ImageListObj  |  *SelItems    |           |
 |   ColTitles  |   Items         |   Size        |           |
 |   FCol       |   Posn          |   View        |           |

* indicates that the property can change after it has been set.

Supported events:

 |  GotFocus  |  ItemDblClick  |  ItemDown  |           |
