# Introduction

EWC stands for "Everywhere WC". EWC is a cross-platform implementation of the `⎕WC`
family of system functions (`⎕WC/⎕WS/⎕WG/⎕NQ/⎕DQ`) that are available in Dyalog APL
for Microsoft Windows.

!!!Note
     During prototyping, the project has been known as JSWC, or "JavaScript WC". 
     Both the code and the documentation for EWC still contain references to JSWC.
     Until the transition is complete, EWC and JSWC should be considered to refer
     to the same thing.
