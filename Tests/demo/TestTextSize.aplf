⍝ how to get the source of the current page?
⍝ src←#.S.BROWSER.PageSource - is the code that was loaded (but with our dynamic tests, that might not be what we're seeing!)
⍝ but this works:

 t←'CssSelector'#.S.Find'body'
 src←t.GetAttribute⊂'outerHTML'

 :For t :In 'Hello to' 'all of the World' 'Hello everyone, JSWC Rocks!'
     t1←t
     t1[⍸t1=' ']←⊂'&nbsp;'
     t1←∊t1
     :If 1 Check∨/∊t t1⍷¨⊂src
         r,←⊂'Could not find text "',t,'" in source code of the page!'
     :EndIf
 :EndFor

⍝ what else could we test?
⍝ I don't think the boxes on the page add anything, so I'll ignore them.
⍝ Perhaps the Demo page could instead have an input for the text size
⍝ and we could then dynamically change it. Maybe even the text could be
⍝ entered into an input control?!

end:
 :If 0<≢r
     r←¯1↓∊(⊆r),¨⎕UCS 10
 :EndIf
